# llm-syllogism

A systematic evaluation framework for analyzing syllogistic reasoning and structural biases in large language models (LLMs).

This repository contains the full pipeline for my independent research project on systematic biases in LLMs’ syllogistic reasoning, later accepted by AAAI 2026 Bridge: Logical and Symbolic Reasoning in Language Models.
The framework automatically generates controlled syllogistic reasoning tasks across all classical forms, queries multiple LLMs concurrently, parses and validates responses, and produces statistical analyses and visualizations.
